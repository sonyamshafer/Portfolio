			<b><span>S</span>o, this is what it looks like when you are brand spanking new to coding. You sit and stare at the teacher like your eyes are falling out of your face, but you can not do any little thing about it. </b> <i> After about three classes, you are confident to start on your first homework assignment, which was due a week ago. Doh! </i>That is ok. You are learning. <u> Only three more months until you take over the world. </u>
